# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

This project is aimed at practicing and testing my knowledge on the concepts of;
* The C Programming LAnguage
* POinters in C
* Arrays in C
* Memory layout in c programing.

All files are edited in Vi and Vim.
All files have been compiled with gcc on ubuntu 20.04 LTS using the options 
`-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`

All the code uses The `Betty` Style. Check it out [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [bettty-doc.pl](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)

All prototypes of all the functions and for the `_putchar` function used to print out to stdout are included in the header file called `main.h`

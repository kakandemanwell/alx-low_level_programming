## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/DBgGt1BaQ75AkikI88WbEw](explain to anyone), without the help of Google:

### General
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters


## Requirements
### General
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl](betty-style.pl) and [https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl](betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to use global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
* You are allowed to use the standard library
